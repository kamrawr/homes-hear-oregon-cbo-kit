# Oregon HOMES/HEAR CBO Program Documentation Kit

This repo is a **documentation bundle** for Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) in Oregon that will help administer or support the **Home Efficiency Rebates (HOMES)** and **Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR)** programs.

It does **not** mirror or replace official guidance. Instead, it:

- Points to **authoritative federal and state documents**
- Summarizes **what matters for CBO program operations**
- Gives you a place to add **your own local SOPs, intake forms, and workflows**

Suggested use:

1. Clone or unzip this repo into your shared drive or GitHub.
2. Add your **CBO-specific procedures** in the `cbo-operations/` folder.
3. Keep the `links/master-link-index.csv` updated as guidance changes.
4. Treat all linked PDFs and web pages as **source of truth** if they conflict with local notes.
