# Oregon HOMES & HEAR Programs – Rules and Fund‑Braiding Logic for CBOs  
_Last updated: based on public guidance as of **November 5, 2025**. This is a working reference, not legal advice._  

---

## 1. Purpose and Audience

This document is meant for **community‑based organizations (CBOs)** and program staff in Oregon who will help households access the **Home Efficiency Rebates (HOMES)** and **Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR)** programs while **stacking multiple funding sources** for whole‑home retrofit and repair projects.

It focuses on:

- The **core federal and Oregon‑specific rules** that shape what you can and cannot combine.  
- **Practical logic** for stacking (braiding) funds across federal, state, utility, and philanthropic sources.  
- Tactics for **documentation, invoicing, and intake triage** that keep projects compliant and maximize impact for low‑ and moderate‑income households.

---

## 2. Quick Glossary

- **HOMES** – Home Efficiency Rebates (IRA §50121). Performance‑based rebates for **whole‑home efficiency retrofits** measured by percent energy savings.  
- **HEAR** – Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (IRA §50122). **Point‑of‑sale rebates** for high‑efficiency electric equipment and enabling upgrades (panel, wiring, insulation, ventilation, etc.) for **LMI households only**.  
- **LMI** – Low‑ or moderate‑income:  
  - **Low‑income**: \< 80% **Area Median Income (AMI)**.  
  - **Moderate‑income**: 80–150% AMI.  
- **Upgrade** – A single, distinct energy improvement (e.g., a heat pump, HPWH, panel upgrade, attic insulation).  
- **Qualified Electrification Project (QEP)** – A bundle of HEAR‑eligible upgrades in one project that meets DOE requirements.  
- **Federal grants** – Includes IRA rebates, WAP grants, some DOE/OHCS programs, and other direct federal incentive grants.  
- **Non‑federal funding** – State, local, utility, philanthropic, private capital, or Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) **loans** and similar products.

## 3. Oregon Program Architecture (HOMES & HEAR)

### 3.1 Funding and Timing

- Oregon received **over \$113 million** from DOE for the two home energy rebate programs.  
- **Rebates are expected to be available starting spring 2026**, pending DOE approval of Oregon’s final implementation plans. citeturn7view0  
- The programs are designed to be **time‑limited** but to build **long‑term delivery infrastructure and workforce capacity** across Oregon. citeturn3view0turn7view0  

### 3.2 Implementers and Territories

- **ODOE** (Oregon Department of Energy) is the grantee and program owner.  
- Two implementers will administer rebates and work with contractors, utilities, and CBOs: citeturn7view0  
  - **Energy Trust of Oregon** – in **investor‑owned electric utility** territories (PGE, Pacific Power, NW Natural gas, Cascade Natural Gas, Avista).  
  - **Earth Advantage** – in **consumer‑owned utilities** (public utilities, co‑ops) and **Idaho Power** territory.

Both implementers will:  

- Process **HOMES and HEAR rebates**, **installation incentives**, and **income verification**.  
- Conduct outreach to **contractors, retailers, distributors, utilities, and communities**.  
- Partner with **CBOs** to ensure **equitable access** to rebates. citeturn7view0  

### 3.3 Program Types and Core Features

**HOMES – Home Efficiency Rebates** citeturn7view0turn4view0  

- **Whole‑home**, performance‑based. Rebates depend on **modeled or measured energy savings**.  
- Projects must achieve **≥ 20% estimated energy savings**; higher tiers (e.g., ≥ 35%) earn higher rebates.  
- Rebates cover **50–100% of project costs up to \$10,000 per project**, with higher coverage for lower‑income households.  
- Applies to **retrofits only** – **not new construction**. citeturn3view0turn7view0  

**HEAR – Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates** citeturn5view0turn7view0  

- **Point‑of‑sale** or contractor‑applied instant rebates for **LMI households**.  
- Covers specific **high‑efficiency electric appliances and enabling measures**, including:  
  - Heat pump for space heating & cooling.  
  - Heat pump water heater.  
  - Electric heat pump clothes dryer.  
  - Electric stove/cooktop/range/oven.  
  - Electric panel/service center.  
  - Electric wiring.  
  - Insulation, air sealing, and ventilation materials.  
- Rebate caps (federal requirements) per dwelling:  
  - Up to **\$14,000 total per LMI dwelling** across all HEAR upgrades.  
  - **100% of project cost** if \<80% AMI; **50%** if 80–150% AMI. citeturn5view2  

Oregon HEAR will mirror these caps and percentages, with program‑specific details in the approved narrative and blueprint.

## 4. Household and Project Eligibility

### 4.1 Building Types and Tenure

From Oregon’s FAQ: citeturn3view0  

- Both programs are open to **single‑family and multifamily homes**, including **owner‑occupied and rental properties**.  
- **HOMES**: **no new construction**.  
- **HEAR**: **both new and existing construction** allowed, aligned with DOE’s HEAR rules (e.g., first‑time purchase or replacement of fossil/non‑electric equipment for key appliances). citeturn5view0  

### 4.2 Income Tiers (Federal Standard)

For both programs, DOE and ODOE use AMI as defined by HUD: citeturn3view0turn4view0  

- **Low‑income**: total household income **\< 80% AMI**.  
- **Moderate‑income**: **80–150% AMI**.  
- **>150% AMI**: **only eligible for HOMES**, not HEAR. citeturn3view0  

Income can be documented via:

- **Tax transcript pathway** (recent tax year).  
- **Categorical eligibility** via participation in approved programs (examples: LIHEAP, SNAP, Medicaid, WIC, Housing programs, WAP, etc.). citeturn3view0turn4view0  

### 4.3 Funding Set‑Asides and Targeting

ODOE’s FAQ sets minimum allocations: citeturn3view0  

- **HOMES**  
  - Open to **all income levels**.  
  - At least **40% of rebate funding** reserved for **low‑income households**.  
  - Additional **10% reserved for low‑income multifamily** households.

- **HEAR**  
  - Limited to **low‑ and moderate‑income households (≤150% AMI)**.  
  - ODOE reserves **60% of HEAR rebate funding for low‑income single‑family** households.  
  - Additional **20% reserved for low‑income multifamily** households.

CBOs should assume **strong priority for low‑income and high‑burden communities**, even though Justice40 is no longer a federal requirement. ODOE still intends to target areas with high energy burden and poverty, using the **Northwest Clean Energy Atlas** map for contractor installation incentives. citeturn3view0  

### 4.4 Retroactivity

Per Oregon’s public guidance: citeturn7view0turn3view0  

- **HEAR** – **No retroactive rebates** for work completed before program launch.  
- **HOMES** – May provide **retroactive rebates** for eligible projects completed **after August 16, 2022** (date of IRA passage) and before launch, **if** they meet all program requirements. ODOE explicitly warns customers not to count on retroactivity due to complexity and still‑evolving requirements.

For CBO design, treat **retroactivity as a bonus if it works out**, not as a core pillar of your funding stack.

## 5. Federal Fund‑Braiding Rules (What Can and Cannot Be Combined)

Section 4.3.2 of DOE’s Program Requirements sets the legal ceiling for fund braiding. citeturn6view0turn6view1  

### 5.1 Two Key Prohibitions

Any HOMES or HEAR project must obey **both** of these:

1. **Total upfront funding cannot exceed total project cost.**  
   - The combined value of **all federal grants, federal loans, and non‑federal funding** for a project **cannot be more than 100% of the project cost**. citeturn6view1  

2. **No double‑dipping federal grants for the same upgrade.**  
   - Neither **HOMES** nor **HEAR** may be combined with **any other federal grant or rebate for the same single upgrade** (or QEP for HEAR). citeturn6view0turn6view1  
   - “Same single upgrade” = that specific heat pump, HPWH, panel, wiring segment, insulation job, etc.  
   - If multiple federal grants are used in one project, they must fund **distinct, separable upgrades**, each clearly identified on invoices with separate labor and material costs. citeturn6view1  

Violations (e.g., multiple federal rebates claimed for the same upgrade) are treated as **violations of federal law** and must be reported to DOE. citeturn6view1  

### 5.2 Allowed Combinations by Category

**1. HOMES + HEAR (two IRA rebates)**  

- ODOE FAQ: projects **may receive a rebate from both programs**, but **not for the same upgrade**. citeturn3view0  
- Practically:  
  - You **can** use **HOMES** for a **whole‑home retrofit package** (e.g., envelope + HVAC efficiency) and **HEAR** for **a distinct electrification upgrade** (e.g., panel, stove) **only if each upgrade is funded by just one federal rebate**.  
  - You **cannot** fund the same heat pump with both HOMES and HEAR.  

**2. Other Federal Grants (e.g., WAP, OHCS‑administered federal weatherization, other DOE grants)**  

- You **can** combine, for example, **WAP** and **HOMES/HEAR** on the **same house**, but each **funding stream must pay for different upgrades**.  
  - Example: WAP covers **health & safety repairs and basic air sealing**, HOMES funds the **deep efficiency package**, HEAR funds a **panel upgrade plus heat pump water heater** – as long as each specific line item belongs to only one federal grant. citeturn6view0turn6view1  

**3. Federal Loans or Loans from Previously Granted Federal Funds**  

- Federal **loan programs** (HUD loans, DOE Revolving Loan Funds, GGRF‑supported financing) **are not treated as grants** and can be used to finance remaining costs beyond IRA rebates. citeturn6view1turn5view1  
- These can **sit on top of HOMES/HEAR** as long as total support still doesn’t exceed 100% of project cost.

**4. Non‑Federal Funding (State, Local, Utility, Philanthropy, CBO Funds)**  

- **State or local programs, utility incentives, and philanthropic funds** **can be layered** with HOMES/HEAR to cover remaining costs, again respecting the **100% of cost ceiling** and any restrictions imposed by those programs. citeturn6view1turn7view0  

**5. Tax Credits (e.g., 25C)**  

- DOE guidance allows **combining tax credits with rebates** under specific rules:  
  - For example, if a product costs \$400 and the household gets a \$100 rebate, a 30% tax credit would apply to the **remaining \$300** (i.e., \$90). citeturn6view1turn1search0  
- ODOE notes: Congress has **terminated IRA efficiency tax credits early**, so they are currently only available for **installations completed through December 31, 2025**. citeturn7view0  
- CBOs should treat federal tax credits as **short‑term opportunities**, mainly relevant for **moderate‑ or higher‑income households with tax liability**.

---

## 6. HEAR‑Specific Rules that Affect Design

Key federal HEAR constraints that matter for stacking and project design: citeturn5view0turn5view2  

- A HEAR rebate can be paid **only for a QEP initiated after the state receives DOE authorization to launch**. No pre‑launch work counts.  
- Each dwelling unit can receive a HEAR rebate **only once per appliance category** (e.g., one heat pump water heater, one heat pump space heating system).  
- A dwelling can receive a rebate for **only one of**: electric stove, cooktop, range, or oven.  
- A dwelling can receive **both** a qualifying kitchen appliance and an electric heat pump clothes dryer, but the combined rebate for both cannot exceed **\$840**.  
- **Maximum HEAR rebate per dwelling**: **\$14,000**.  
- For LMI households and multifamily buildings, HEAR can cover **100% or 50% of qualified project cost** depending on income and building composition.  

For CBOs, this means:

- **Think long‑term**: HEAR rebates are essentially **once‑per‑category** per dwelling. Don’t “burn” a category on a marginal upgrade if a deeper project is coming.  
- Coordinate with landlords carefully for **multifamily** so you don’t exhaust a unit’s HEAR eligibility on low‑impact measures.

## 7. Oregon‑Level Program Design Details Relevant to Braiding

### 7.1 Relationship to Other Oregon Programs

ODOE explicitly encourages households to combine HOMES/HEAR with **other existing incentives**: citeturn7view0turn3view0  

- **Energy Trust of Oregon** and **public‑utility efficiency programs** (via the **Energy HIPPO incentives finder**, incentives.oregon.gov).  
- **State heat pump programs**:  
  - Oregon Heat Pump Purchase Program.  
  - Community Heat Pump Deployment Program.  
  - Oregon Rental Home Heat Pump Program (limited availability).  
- **OHCS Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)** for low‑income households.  

CBOs should use **HIPPO** and local utility contacts to identify **non‑federal rebates** that can sit alongside HOMES/HEAR.

### 7.2 Contractor Participation

Federal rules require most HOMES projects and HEAR projects involving assessments to use **pre‑approved qualified contractors** on ODOE’s list. citeturn3view0turn4view0  

- CBOs should **build relationships early** with contractors likely to enroll.  
- Ensure contractors understand:  
  - **Line‑item invoicing** by upgrade.  
  - Keeping **documentation of which fund paid for which upgrade**.  
  - Income documentation and customer consent requirements.

## 8. Practical Fund‑Braiding Logic for CBO Projects

Below is a **decision framework** CBOs can use when designing funding stacks for holistic home projects. It respects the rules above but is **strategic**, not prescriptive program guidance.

### 8.1 High‑Level Intake Logic

For each household:

1. **Determine geography and implementer**  
   - Use **“Find Your Utility”** and HIPPO to identify whether the home is in **Energy Trust** or **Earth Advantage** territory. citeturn7view0  

2. **Assess household income and eligibility**  
   - Confirm **AMI tier** (low \<80%, moderate 80–150%, high >150%).  
   - Screen for **categorical eligibility** (SNAP, LIHEAP, Medicaid, WIC, housing programs, etc.). citeturn3view0  

3. **Assess building and safety conditions**  
   - Identify **deal‑breakers** for electrification/efficiency (unsafe wiring, knob‑and‑tube, severe roof issues, failing ducts, mold/asbestos).  
   - Decide whether **OHCS WAP or other repair programs** need to go first for health & safety and enabling work. citeturn3view0turn7view0  

4. **Define the project type**  
   - **Whole‑home retrofit with multi‑measure savings** → likely **HOMES anchor**.  
   - **Targeted electrification/enabling upgrades** (HP, HPWH, panel, wiring) for LMI → likely **HEAR anchor**.  
   - **Mixed** (e.g., big retrofit + electrification) → could use **HOMES + HEAR on distinct upgrades**.

5. **Inventory all potential funding sources**  
   - Federal: HOMES, HEAR, WAP, other DOE grants.  
   - **State**: heat pump programs.  
   - **Utility**: Energy Trust/other utility incentives.  
   - **Local/Other**: city/county funds, PCEF‑type grants, philanthropy, landlord contributions, GGRF‑backed loans or credit union products.

6. **Assign upgrades to funding sources** following these rules:  
   - **One federal grant per upgrade** (HOMES, HEAR, WAP, etc.). citeturn6view1  
   - Use **state/utility/philanthropic funds to close remaining gaps**.  
   - Ensure **total upfront funding ≤ 100%** of project cost. citeturn6view1  

### 8.2 Example Stacking Patterns (Illustrative Only)

These are **patterns**, not program commitments. Always confirm details with ODOE and implementers.

#### Pattern A – Low‑Income Single‑Family Gas Home, Deep Retrofit + Electrification

**Household**: \<80% AMI, single‑family home, gas furnace + gas water heater, high energy burden, significant shell issues.

**Goals**: Weatherization, heat pump, HPWH, panel upgrade, basic health & safety repairs.

**Potential stack:**

- **WAP or similar low‑income weatherization/repair program (federal)**  
  - Funds **critical health & safety** (roof patching, combustion safety fixes, minor wiring repairs that are not the same as the later HEAR panel upgrade), and **baseline weatherization** (some air sealing/insulation).  
  - **Avoid funding the exact same insulation or panel upgrade you plan to claim under HOMES/HEAR.**  

- **HOMES (federal)**  
  - Anchors the **whole‑home efficiency package** (e.g., air sealing, remaining insulation, duct sealing, smart thermostat, and potentially the high‑efficiency heat pump if you do **not** use HEAR for it).  
  - Must hit **≥20% energy savings** (ideally ≥35%). citeturn7view0turn4view0  

- **HEAR (federal)**  
  - Funds **distinct upgrades** NOT funded by WAP or HOMES, such as:  
    - **Panel/service upgrade** and **branch‑circuit wiring** needed for electrification.  
    - **Heat pump water heater** (HPWH) if HOMES covers the space‑conditioning side.  
  - Keep within **\$14,000 total** and **one rebate per appliance category**. citeturn5view0turn5view2  

- **Utility incentives (non‑federal)**  
  - Additional rebates for the **heat pump** and HPWH as allowed by Energy Trust/utility rules, stacked **on top of** HOMES or HEAR, respecting the 100% cost ceiling. citeturn7view0turn1search3  

- **GGRF‑backed loan / local credit union loan (federal loan product)**  
  - Covers any remaining customer co‑pay while keeping monthly payments affordable.  

**Key design notes:**  

- Break the scope into **clearly separable line items** with funding source tags (e.g., WAP, HOMES, HEAR, Utility, Loan). citeturn6view1  
- Decide **early** whether the heat pump is funded by HOMES or HEAR to avoid any chance of double counting.  

#### Pattern B – Moderate‑Income Renter in Small Multifamily Building

**Household**: 100% AMI renter in a 6‑unit multifamily building, electric resistance heat, high bills.

**Goals**: Central VRF heat pump system, moderate shell work, panel upgrades.

**Potential stack:**  

- **HEAR (federal)**  
  - Owner or eligible entity representative claims **per‑unit HEAR allocations** (up to \$14,000 per LMI unit) to support the **central heat pump system** and associated panel/wiring work. citeturn5view0turn5view2  

- **HOMES (federal)**  
  - If the building also pursues deeper shell upgrades beyond the HEAR‑funded heat pump/panel scope, **HOMES can fund a separate set of upgrades** tied to measured whole‑building energy savings (e.g., windows, added insulation) – **as long as those specific shell measures are not paid by another federal grant**. citeturn6view1turn1search3  

- **OHCS WAP (federal)**  
  - May cover **different upgrades** (e.g., some health & safety work, ventilation improvements) that are **not the same upgrades** used for HOMES/HEAR.  

- **Utility / Local programs (non‑federal)**  
  - Additional incentives for central HVAC systems or shell measures as allowed.  

**Key design notes:**  

- For multifamily, decide **who claims the rebates** (owner, households, or an eligible entity representative) and document consent and benefit pass‑through. citeturn5view0turn5view2  
- Track **per‑unit caps** and ensure no unit exceeds the **\$14k HEAR maximum** or receives duplicate federal grants for the same upgrade.  

#### Pattern C – >150% AMI Homeowner in IOU Territory

**Household**: Above 150% AMI; already electrified gas furnace to heat pump; wants shell upgrades and possibly a battery later.

**Eligibility reality:**  

- **Not eligible for HEAR** (limited to ≤150% AMI). citeturn3view0  
- **Eligible for HOMES** if retrofits meet savings thresholds.  

**Potential stack:**  

- **HOMES** for the deep shell work, possibly combined with system tuning to push energy savings above 20% (ideally ≥35%).  
- **IRA tax credits** if work is completed by **Dec 31, 2025** and credits still available. citeturn7view0turn6view1  
- **Energy Trust/utility incentives**, state/local programs, and private financing.  

For CBOs, this is mainly a **boundary case**: you may still provide guidance, but not prioritize scarce community resources here.

## 9. Tactics and Strategies to Optimize Funding Stacks

### 9.1 Design Funding Around Upgrades, Not Programs

**Core idea:** Start by **designing the optimal technical package** (health, safety, efficiency, electrification) and then assign each upgrade to the **best available funding source** under the constraints above.

**Steps:**  

1. Map each **specific upgrade** (e.g., “replace gas furnace with cold‑climate HP”, “attic R‑value from R‑11 to R‑49”, “main panel from 60A to 200A”).  
2. For each upgrade, ask:  
   - Is it **HOMES‑eligible** (part of whole‑home energy savings)?  
   - Is it **HEAR‑eligible** (qualifying appliance or enabling measure for an LMI household)? citeturn5view0turn5view2  
   - Is it more naturally funded by **WAP**, **state heat pump programs**, **utility rebates**, or **local grants**?  
3. Assign **exactly one federal grant** per upgrade. If a line item is already covered by WAP, **do not assign HOMES/HEAR to that same item**.  
4. Use **non‑federal funds and loans** to fill the remaining gap.

### 9.2 Invoice and Documentation Design

To stay fully compliant and make audits painless:

- Require contractors to provide **line‑item invoices** where each upgrade has:  
  - Description of work.  
  - Materials and labor separated.  
  - Per‑upgrade cost.  
  - A column for **“Funding Source”** (HOMES, HEAR, WAP, Utility, State HP program, Local grant, Customer, Loan, etc.). citeturn6view1turn5view2  
- Maintain a **funding stack worksheet** per project that:  
  - Totals **all upfront funding** and confirms it **≤ 100% of project cost**.  
  - Confirms that **no upgrade has more than one federal grant/rebate**.  
  - Tracks HEAR appliance‑category usage and cumulative rebates vs the \$14k cap.  
- Store **income documentation** (AMI and/or categorical eligibility) and **utility territory verification** in a secure system, with clear audit trails. citeturn3view0turn4view0  

### 9.3 CBO Workflow Tactics

- **Segment your client base** by income and housing type so you know **who is likely HOMES‑only, HEAR‑eligible, or both**.  
- Build **standard project archetypes** (like the patterns in Section 8.2) for:  
  - **Old gas SF homes in IOU territory**.  
  - **All‑electric manufactured homes**.  
  - **Small LMI multifamily**.  
  - **Tribal housing**.  
- For each archetype, pre‑define:  
  - A **preferred funding stack** (e.g., WAP → HOMES → HEAR → Utility → Loan).  
  - **Contractor partners** capable of delivering that stack.  
  - A **documentation checklist**.

### 9.4 Using Loans and Philanthropy Wisely

Given the federal restriction that **federal grants cannot exceed project cost**, but federal **loans and GGRF products are separate**, CBOs can: citeturn6view1turn5view1  

- Use HOMES/HEAR + WAP + state/utility funds to bring project cost down as close to zero as possible.  
- Use **low‑interest loans** only for **remaining co‑pays**, and aim for **short terms** for low‑income households (or use philanthropic dollars to buy down principal/interest).  
- For very low‑income households with no repayment capacity, prioritize **direct grants and layered non‑federal funds** over loans.

---

## 10. Risk Flags and Open Items

Even with published narratives and FAQs, some implementation details will continue to evolve through ODOE’s **Implementation Blueprints** and implementer program manuals. citeturn4view0turn7view0  

CBOs should treat this document as **guidance anchored in current rules**, and watch for:

- Final **Oregon‑specific HOMES/HEAR program manuals** from ODOE, Energy Trust, and Earth Advantage.  
- Updates to **tax credit availability** and any future federal or state legislative changes.  
- Any new **OHCS, PCEF, local, or philanthropic programs** that interact with these rebates.  

When in doubt:

- **Do not stack two federal grants on the same line item**, and  
- Keep **total upfront funding ≤ 100% of project cost** and **fully documented**.

That keeps you inside the guardrails while still pushing for **maximum savings and equity** for the households you serve.
