# Contributing to Oregon HOMES/HEAR CBO Kit

Thank you for your interest in improving this documentation kit for CBOs working with Oregon's Home Energy Rebate programs!

## How to Contribute

### For CBOs Using This Kit

1. **Share your local procedures** - If you've developed intake forms, eligibility screening processes, or data management workflows, consider contributing anonymized versions to help other CBOs.

2. **Update links** - As federal and state guidance changes, help keep `links/master-link-index.csv` current by submitting updates.

3. **Report issues** - If you find broken links, unclear documentation, or missing information, open an issue describing what needs improvement.

### Making Changes

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-improvement`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with clear messages (`git commit -m "Add intake workflow template"`)
5. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/your-improvement`)
6. Open a Pull Request

### Guidelines

- **Remove any PII or sensitive data** before contributing
- Keep documentation **clear and practical** for frontline CBO staff
- Link to **authoritative sources** rather than duplicating content

- Update the relevant README files when adding new sections

### What to Contribute

- Templates and checklists
- Process flowcharts
- Links to updated guidance
- Best practices from field experience
- Clarifications on confusing program rules

**Please avoid:**
- Client data or PII
