# CBO Operations – Working with HOMES & HEAR in Oregon

This folder is for **operational notes** and **local procedures** for CBOs that are helping households and contractors access HOMES and HEAR.

The two files included here are starting points for you to expand.

## 1. Intake, Eligibility & Targeting (`intake-eligibility.md`)

Use this file to document how your CBO will:

- Screen households for **income eligibility** (using AMI thresholds and ODOE guidance).
- Track **housing type** (single-family vs multifamily; owner vs renter).
- Identify **measure pathways**:
  - Whole-home performance retrofits for **HOMES** (≥20% or ≥35% modeled savings).
  - Appliance and electrification upgrades for **HEAR** with rebate caps up to $14,000.
- Coordinate with:
  - Energy Trust (investor-owned utility territories).
  - Earth Advantage (consumer-owned + Idaho Power territories).

You may want to embed your own:

- Intake scripts
- Consent language
- Checklists for documents (proof of income, utility bills, rental agreements)

## 2. Data, Privacy & Reporting (`data-privacy-reporting.md`)

ODOE and DOE documents lay out **data and reporting requirements** that ultimately flow through implementers. Use this file to define:

- What **PII** and household data your CBO will collect / not collect.
- How you will **store and protect** that data.
- How you will **share data** with:
  - Implementers (Energy Trust / Earth Advantage)
  - Utilities
  - Other funding partners (LIHEAP, WAP, PCEF, local government, etc.)

Flag issues for your organization:

- Minimum data needed to qualify households for rebates.
- When to use **stacked funding** instead of HOMES/HEAR if federal rules (or federal data capture) increase risk for certain communities.
- How to respond to **public records** or **immigration-related** risks, using local policies and legal counsel.

These docs don’t prescribe policy – they give you a place to **write down how your CBO will actually run the work**, aligned with state and federal rules.
