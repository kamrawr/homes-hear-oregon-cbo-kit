# Data, Privacy & Reporting – Template

This template is to help your CBO align internal policies with HOMES/HEAR requirements while protecting community members.

## 1. Data you collect

List what you collect at intake and during project delivery, for example:

- Name, contact info
- Address and utility account info
- Household size and income bracket (not necessarily exact income)
- Demographic info (only if needed and with a clear purpose)
- Project details (measures, costs, contractors, modeling results)

## 2. Storage and retention

Decide and document:

- Where data is stored (CRM, spreadsheets, cloud services).
- Encryption / access controls.
- How long you retain records and who can access them.

## 3. Sharing and reporting

Clarify when and how you share data with:

- Implementers (Energy Trust, Earth Advantage)
- ODOE and other state agencies
- Utilities
- Other funders

Explicitly flag:

- When your CBO can use **non-federal funding** to reduce exposure to federal data rules for undocumented or otherwise high-risk residents.
- Policies for **opting out** of certain data sharing while still providing services where possible.

Work with legal counsel and program administrators to keep this section current.
