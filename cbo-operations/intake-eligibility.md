# Intake, Eligibility & Targeting – Template

Use this as a starting point and adapt to your CBO.

## 1. Basic household screening

- **Location**  
  - Utility territory (PGE, Pacific Power, NW Natural, Cascade, Avista, consumer-owned, Idaho Power).  
  - Confirm whether the project will fall under **Energy Trust** or **Earth Advantage** implementation.

- **Income eligibility**  
  - Under 80% AMI → **low-income**  
  - 80–150% AMI → **moderate-income**  
  - Above 150% AMI → may still be eligible for HOMES (depending on design) but not HEAR.

- **Housing type**  
  - Single-family / manufactured / multifamily (number of units).  
  - Ownership status (owner-occupied vs renter).

## 2. Program fit

- **HOMES path** (performance-based retrofit)  
  - Whole-house efficiency package expected to deliver ≥20% or ≥35% energy savings.  
  - Requires modeled savings using DOE-approved tools and 12 months of utility data.

- **HEAR path** (appliance and electrification rebates)  
  - Heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, panel upgrades, wiring, ventilation, insulation, air sealing, etc.  
  - Point-of-sale discounts at participating retailers and/or post-install incentives through implementers.  
  - Must meet federal product and income rules.

## 3. Other programs to consider

- LIHEAP, WAP, and state/local weatherization programs.  
- Utility rebates and bill assistance.  
- Local resilience / cooling / heating relief programs.
