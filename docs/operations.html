            <h2>Your Role in Program Delivery</h2>
            <p>As a Community-Based Organization, you serve as a crucial bridge between Oregon households and the HOMES/HEAR programs. This guide outlines operational best practices for supporting your community.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <strong>Key Principle:</strong> CBOs do not administer rebates directly. Energy Trust and Earth Advantage are the implementers. Your role is to support intake, education, referrals, and follow-up.

        <section id="intake">
            <h2>Intake & Screening Process</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Initial Contact & Awareness</h3>
            <p>When a household first inquires about energy assistance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understand their needs:</strong> Are they facing high energy bills? Broken equipment? Cold/hot home?</li>
                <li><strong>Explain the programs:</strong> Briefly describe HOMES (whole-home efficiency) and HEAR (electric appliances)</li>
                <li><strong>Set expectations:</strong> Programs expected to launch in 2026; in the meantime, explore existing utility and state programs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Basic Screening Questions</h3>

            <h2>Data Privacy & Protection</h2>

            <h3>What Data You Collect</h3>
            <p>Your CBO's intake forms should collect only the minimum necessary data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> Name, phone, email, address</li>
                <li><strong>Household size:</strong> Number of people living in the home</li>
                <li><strong>Approximate income:</strong> Enough to estimate AMI eligibility tier</li>
                <li><strong>Utility information:</strong> Electric and gas providers</li>
                <li><strong>Housing type:</strong> Own/rent, single-family/multi, age of home</li>
                <li><strong>Energy needs:</strong> What improvements or appliances are needed</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <strong>What NOT to collect (unless required by your partner agreements):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Social Security Numbers</li>
                    <li>Immigration status</li>
                    <li>Detailed financial records</li>
                    <li>Sensitive personal information unrelated to program eligibility</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Data Storage & Security</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use secure systems:</strong> Encrypted databases, password-protected files, secure CRM platforms</li>
                <li><strong>Limit access:</strong> Only staff who need the data should have access</li>
                <li><strong>Retention policy:</strong> Define how long you keep records; comply with grant requirements</li>
                <li><strong>Backup & recovery:</strong> Regularly back up data to prevent loss</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Protecting Vulnerable Communities</h3>
            <p>Special considerations for undocumented residents and others with documentation barriers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Self-attestation options:</strong> Work with implementers to use self-declaration for income when tax returns aren't available</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative pathways:</strong> Categorical eligibility (e.g., SNAP participation) can streamline verification</li>
                <li><strong>Non-federal funding:</strong> If federal data requirements pose risks, explore using local/state funds for similar services</li>
                <li><strong>Know your limits:</strong> Clearly communicate what data you collect, who sees it, and whether it's shared with federal agencies</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <strong>Work with implementers and legal counsel</strong> to develop data-sharing agreements that protect your community members while meeting program requirements.

            <h3>Reporting to Partners</h3>
            <p>If you have formal partnerships or contracts with implementers, ODOE, or funders:</p>

                <li><strong>Use standardized forms:</strong> Ask partners for templates to ensure consistency</li>
