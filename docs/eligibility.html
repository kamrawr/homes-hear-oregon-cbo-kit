            <h2>Income Eligibility</h2>
            
            <p>Both HOMES and HEAR use Area Median Income (AMI) to determine household eligibility and rebate amounts. Income limits vary by county and household size.</p>

            <h3>Income Categories</h3>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Category</th>

            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <strong>Finding AMI Thresholds:</strong> Specific income limits by county and household size will be published by ODOE and implementers. These are updated annually. Check with Energy Trust or Earth Advantage for current limits in your service area.
            </div>

            <h3>Income Verification</h3>
            <p>Implementers will accept various forms of income documentation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tax returns:</strong> Previous year's federal tax return (1040)</li>
                <li><strong>Pay stubs:</strong> Recent pay stubs covering 30-60 days</li>
                <li><strong>W-2 or 1099 forms:</strong> Previous year's wage statements</li>
                <li><strong>Benefit letters:</strong> SSI, SSDI, SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, public housing assistance</li>
                <li><strong>Self-declaration:</strong> For households with barriers to traditional documentation</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic enrollment:</strong> Households already verified for certain programs (utility assistance, WAP, LIHEAP)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="alert alert-success">
                <strong>Streamlined Verification:</strong> Implementers are developing simplified income verification processes, especially for households already enrolled in other assistance programs.

                <li><strong>Utility billing history:</strong> 12 months of electric/gas usage data (often obtained directly from utility by implementer)</li>
                <li><strong>Energy modeling:</strong> Pre-retrofit home energy assessment and post-retrofit modeling (performed by qualified contractor/assessor)</li>

            <h2>Special Considerations</h2>

            <h3>Priority Populations</h3>
            <p>The programs prioritize households that are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low-income (≤80% AMI)</li>
                <li>Located in disadvantaged communities (Justice40 areas)</li>
                <li>Living in older, inefficient housing stock</li>
                <li>Currently using fossil fuel heating systems (candidates for electrification)</li>
                <li>Facing high energy burden (energy costs are >6% of household income)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Households Without Traditional Documentation</h3>
            <p>Implementers are developing alternative pathways for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Undocumented residents</li>
                <li>Households without SSNs</li>
                <li>Cash-based income households</li>
                <li>Households fleeing domestic violence</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <strong>Privacy & Safety:</strong> Work with implementers to understand what minimum data is required and how to protect vulnerable community members. Self-attestation and categorical eligibility options may be available.
            </div>

            <h3>Stacking with Other Programs</h3>
            <p>HOMES and HEAR can often be combined with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP):</strong> Federal weatherization program for low-income households</li>
                <li><strong>LIHEAP:</strong> Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program</li>
                <li><strong>Utility rebates:</strong> Existing energy efficiency incentives from utilities</li>
                <li><strong>Federal tax credits:</strong> 25C (energy efficiency) and 25D (renewable energy) tax credits</li>
                <li><strong>Local programs:</strong> County, city, or nonprofit energy assistance programs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Work with implementers to optimize rebate stacking and avoid duplication of benefits for the same measures.</p>
