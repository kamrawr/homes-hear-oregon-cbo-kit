# Oregon HOMES & HEAR – Core State Documents

These are the **anchor documents** for how Oregon is designing and running the HOMES and HEAR programs.

## Official ODOE program pages

- ODOE – *Home Energy Rebate Programs (HOMES & HEAR)* (program landing page)  
  https://www.oregon.gov/energy/Incentives/Pages/home-energy-rebates.aspx

- ODOE – *Incentives overview* (includes Home Energy Rebates section)

Key takeaways to flag for CBOs:

- Approx. **$113.6 million** allocated to Oregon across HOMES and HEAR, with about **$91.4 million** expected to flow as rebates and incentives after admin costs.  
- **Energy Trust of Oregon** and **Earth Advantage** are the two statewide implementers – they will process rebates, verify income, and lead outreach, partnering with utilities and CBOs.  
- Programs are expected to **launch in 2026**, pending final DOE approval.  
- HOMES can be **retroactive to projects after Aug 16, 2022** if they meet all requirements; HEAR **cannot be retroactive**.
