## What CBOs should pull out of these

- **Definitions** of HOMES vs HEAR, and interactions with Justice40, income limits, and retroactivity.
- **Required consumer protections** (complaint handling, quality assurance, contractor standards).
- **Data and reporting requirements** – what must ultimately flow back to DOE.
- **Flexibilities** states have in designing incentives, aggregators, and delivery models.
